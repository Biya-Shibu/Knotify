### Project Description
This is a matrimonial platform that combines tradition with a health-conscious approach. Alongside profiles, users provide essential premarital test results such as STD screenings and blood compatibility to promote transparent, informed matches. Importantly, test results and personal details are accessible only with user consent, ensuring privacy and control. This health-first platform empowers families to make safe, responsible choices for a harmonious future.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Approximately 140 million women face complications during pregnancy due to Rh factor incompatibility, and around 70 million people may have an STD at any given time.In India, where arranged marriages are common, ensuring safety is paramount. But how?
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our website prioritizes health and compatibility by requiring users to provide their Rh compatibility test and RPR test results, along with other essential details, with their consent. Profiles will be displayed based on Rh compatibility to ensure alignment with the respective user's profile, promoting both safety and informed matching on our platform.You can only view the test results and details after accepting the request. This approach fosters informed and safer matrimonial choices, ensuring a more secure foundation for relationships.
