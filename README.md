### Project Description
Knotify is a unique matrimonial platform that blends tradition with health awareness. Users provide essential premarital test results to ensure transparency in compatibility and safety. Personal details and test results are only visible with user consent, preserving privacy.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In India, where arranged marriages are popular, there‚Äôs a *gap* in health transparency for safe and compatible matches!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We're combining romance with real talk about blood compatibility and health screenings‚Äîbecause what‚Äôs more romantic than transparency in love and health?
